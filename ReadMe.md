## Introduction
This document presents supplemental material for use when running the Adventure League module FR-DC-STRAT-DUNGEON-01, 
“The Crooked Tower.” It is not a stand alone product – you must have already purchased 
that module separately to use this document.

FR-DC-STRAT-DUNGEON-01 can be purchased online at DmsGuild.com.

The content consists of these files:
- Readme.md - this file
- CrookedTowerMaps_v1.0.pdf - Detailed maps of the tower, presented in a 1 inch to 5 foot scale.
- CrookedTower_Upper_1b.stl - A 3D printer file to create a prop of the architetual models used to unlock the safe in the final room.
The intent is to print two out and then allow the players to figure out how they attach to one another as part of the final puzzle.
    - There are two divots in the side of the tower suitable for concealed 0.5 inch disk magnets. You will need
    four magnets total. I was able to find them at Home Depot, but there are many other online sources.
    - Attach the magnets with superglue then cover the gaps with putty and then paint the whole thing. Make sure to test the magnet
    polarities to be sure the two models connect before gluing.
- CrookedTower_Upper_1a.scad - An OpenScad file used to generate the STL file in case you need to modify it. 
You can download and install OpenScad from OpenScad.org or use an online tool by searching for "Openscad Playground."
- TBD.pdf (work in progress) - A template to cut a piece of cardboard representing the key slot in the final room's safe. Give it to them
on entering the final room.
The players can use it to test the oriantation of the two models and when they twist it, the safe opens.
