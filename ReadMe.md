## Introduction
This document presents supplemental material for use when running the Adventure League module FR-DC-STRAT-DUNGEON-01, 
“The Crooked Tower.” It is not a stand alone product – you must have already purchased 
that module separately to use this document.

FR-DC-STRAT-DUNGEON-01 can be purchased online at DmsGuild.com.

The content consists of these files:
- Readme.md - this file
- CrookedTowerMaps_v1.0.pdf - Detailed maps of the tower, presented in a 1 inch to 5 foot scale.
- CrookedTower_Upper_*.stl - A 3D printer file to create a prop of the architetual models used to unlock the safe in the final room.
The intent is to print two out and then allow the players to figure out how they attach to one another as part of the final puzzle.
    - There are two divots in the side of the tower suitable for concealed 0.5 inch disk magnets. You will need
    four magnets total. I was able to find them at Home Depot, but there are many other online sources.
    - Insert the magnets into the divots and secure them with tape in order to test the fit and orientation. 
    In my case, I made sure that the upper magnet in cube B3
    had its South pole facing out so that the North end of a compass needle was drawn to it. The second magnet 
    in cube B2 was reversed (North pole outwards so that it attracted the South end of a compass needle).
    If this is done on two models, they will snap together so they face different directions.
    - Once you are happy with the magnets,    
    superglue them in place and cover the gaps with putty. Then sand, primer, paint, and seal it as you wish.
    I found that a white primer base and running a black permamanet marker over the lettering works quite well.
- CrookedTower_Upper_*.scad - An OpenScad file used to generate the STL file in case you need to modify it. 
You can download and install OpenScad from OpenScad.org or use an online tool by searching for "Openscad Playground."
- TBD.pdf (work in progress) - A template to cut a piece of cardboard representing the key slot in the final room's safe. Give it to them
on entering the final room.
The players can use it to test the oriantation of the two models and when they twist it, the safe opens.
